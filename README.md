# UNIQLO Tech Test - Adam Story

My response to the UNIQLO tech test.

## Plan

- Init local repo and link to GitHub repo
- Upload all the relevant files to repository

-

## Notes on brief

- User should: know when offer is live, what's on offer and how to get it.
- Should be mobile first, responsive web design
- First section (countdown): full height asset (should be same height on mobile/web), countdown to 6th March 2022, should support singular forms (i.e. 1 day/minute/second instead of 1 days/minutes/seconds)
- Second section (carousel): Use SplideJS, swipe/click functionality, hide arrows on mobile but keep scroll enabled,  
- Footer section (get user registration): register or download UNIQLO app, QR code on web becomes app badges on mobile
- Provide with zip folder to view HTML on browser

## Brief

UNIQLO Technical Test

Design & assets: https://image.uniqlo.com/UQ/ST3/eu/imagesother/technical-test.zip

Thank you for your interest in UNIQLO and in taking our technical test. We would like to see your technical skills in action!

The link above contains 2 designs (desktop and mobile) for an idea that we had to offer UNIQLO members exclusive discounts. This page acts as a teaser informing the visitors when the offer will be live, what will be on offer and how to get it.

The first section contains a countdown on top of a full height asset with some copy.

The second section is a carousel where customers can swipe/click through the promotions available.

Lastly, the footer section encourages the customer to become a member by either registering on our website or downloading our UNIQLO app.

We would like you to develop this page (all assets are included in the zip folder) to the best of your ability. The design needs to be responsive. We would also love to see a mobile-first approach.

In the hero section, where you can find the countdown, the background asset needs to be the same height as the customerâ€™s browser for both mobile and desktop. The countdown needs to be functional. Please ensure it counts down to 6th of March 2022. When the days, hours, minutes or seconds reach 1, the text needs to be updated to the singular form (day, hour, minute, second).

In terms of the carousel in the second section, please use SplideJS. This is what we use across our website. On mobile, the arrows need to be hidden, but the overall functionality of the carousel still needs to exist. Customers should be able to scroll through the different products.
Lastly, in the footer section, on desktop we present the visitor with a QR code linking to our APP. On mobile, this QR code is replaced with the app badges.

Feel free to use any CSS preprocessors during your development. In terms of JavaScript, please only use native JavaScript. The folder structure of your project will be up to you. Upon completing the test, please provide us with a zip folder containing an index.html file that will allow us to open in browser and view your work where the CSS is applied and JavaScript is running.
